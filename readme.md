# Panoptes-documentation

The documentation for the Panoptes project.

We separated out the documentation for the Panoptes project to avoid the situation where people are deploying spurious 
documentation.

`/docs` contains the markdown documentation for [Panoptes](https://www.github.com/yahoo/panoptes)

`/website` contains [Docusaurus.io](https://docusaurus.io/) metadata for building the [documentation website]()
